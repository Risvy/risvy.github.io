üë®‚Äçüíª I'm a recent Graduate from CSE, SUST.

üìä My research interests are in Computer & Cyber Security, Privacy and Blockchain.

üìö Looking for PhD opportunities in CS for Fall '24.

# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è More About Me
I'm very much passionate about writing codes, learning, and building new things. I love to solve complex problems, take challenges & enjoy getting the job done. Always curious to learn. Always excited to work as a team. Our team was two times finalist in the Blockchain Olympiad Bangladesh (2021 & 2022). I had the opportunity to code and develop some exciting projects in recent years. 

In addition to academic activities, I love to take part in sports. I have been an active participant in various types of games and sports from a young age. Besides, I had some experience in public speaking and also had the opportunity to lead some teams in mentionable debate competitions.

# üî¨ Undergraduate Thesis
**Title:** Security Analysis of Software-Based Cryptocurrency Wallets.<br>
**Short Description:** The goal of this thesis is to find the security vulnerabilities of cryptocurrency wallets as well as to get an overall idea about the privacy and permissions they ask from their users. Our methods focus on using vulnerability assessment tools and user reviews to identify the factors that contribute to their perceived security and usability. Both manual and Machine Learning approaches were taken to analyze the user reviews to determine how well they can keep cryptos safe and accessible. This work is in the process of publishing. I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Jabed Morshed Chowdhury](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n3jMWFQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Dr. Sadek Ferdous Ripul](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DnQAee0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) as my thesis supervisors. **This work is soon to be submitted to the journal [Cybersecurity published by SpringerOpen](https://cybersecurity.springeropen.com/).**
